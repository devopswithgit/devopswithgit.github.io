Nothing changed. </p><p>You will see the following in the BannerForPerson log file in D:\AccmanLogs\TransactionLogs\1504 (note, line 15 is the most important but the full log entry is shown for completeness)</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

</div></div><p>As you can see, even changing the data in Banner is not enough. Because Accman now has 2017 as its most 'current' term, it simply rejects the 2016 information it receives from the Banner Import because that's 'older'.</p><p>Note: LanDesk case INC190103 reported this issue. One common theme is that they were all students who had changed course. This could be part of the cause, or it could be a red herring.</p><h1 id="Studentswith2017recordsmarkedas&#39;Expected&#39;-Solution">Solution</h1><p>You still need to remove the 2017 record from Banner (Paul Farrell did this for me), and <strong>also</strong> remove change the PERSON.ACAD_SESS and PERSON.STU_TERM columns so that they are back to 2016 and 201610 respectively. </p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: sql; gutter: false; theme: Confluence" data-theme="Confluence">update person set acad_sess = 2016, stu_term = &#39;201610&#39; where rollnumber = 387374 limit 1;</pre>
</div></div><p>Then, when the Banner Import runs next time, it will set the student back to 'Present' instead of 'Expected'. Also, once the ETL runs overnight, the student will be able to see their timetable again.</p><p>If SA still need to put the 2017 record back, they can now do this without having to worry about the Person record reverting back to 'Expected'.</p>
