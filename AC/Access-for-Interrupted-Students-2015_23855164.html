                    <p>The university is looking to address the issue of student retention and subsequent progression. At present there are a significant number of students who do not progress from their first year (level 4) to their second year (level 5), this has a cumulative impact on the income in subsequent years. One key issue is the fact that students who have interrupted can no longer access any UoS IT, Library or VLE systems due to the current governance policy around UoS systems access.  Phase 1 of the Improving Student Retention project involves e<span style="line-height: 1.4285715;">xtending the access rights for interrupting students.  Currently interrupting students have all access withdrawn, including email.  Going forward the university is looking to retain access to the following for interrupting students:</span></p><ol><li>Email account</li><li>Files on Personal F: drive</li><li>Physical library access</li><li>External Borrows library borrowing rights. (In line with the community access scheme).</li></ol><p>This will require changes to the Accman processing that disables access for interrupting students. </p>

This would hae a major impact for PhD students. We did discuss the possibility of a student not having access to their F drive whilst on interruption but I would say as a minimum that they shoudl be able to access content on return from interruption.   </p><p>Annette  </p></font>
