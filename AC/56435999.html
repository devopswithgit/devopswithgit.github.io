                    <p>Based on Live Support Case: INC<span style="color: rgb(33,48,74);">249947</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(33,48,74);">Staff account BNS407 was in a very odd state: Printed, with a PersonID set, so the account and person records were linked, but there were none of the usual transactions associated with setting up a new account. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(33,48,74);">Looking into the SelfReg table, I could see several failed attempts at registering and then the user got locked for trying too many times. I know the user had been trying to register and it was in office hours so I think it was legit - the user was probably entering incorrect details into the Staff Self Activation page. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(33,48,74);">Because the account's PersonID had a value, subsequent attempts at self activating were prevented. The user had somehow got herself into a state that the self activation website couldn't handle and kept insisting that she was all set up correctly.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(33,48,74);">In order to get it working, I set the BNS407 account's PersonID back to -1 so it went back into the pool of unused, pregenerated accounts, and then the next self activation attempt proceeded as normal because her person record was no longer linked to any accounts. It assigned her a new account (BNS410) and kicked of a register transaction, which created her AD account and Mailbox. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(33,48,74);">The day before she obtained her swipecard from Estates so we were a little concerned that her existing card would no longer work, but after looking into it, Sateon links the card to the rollnumber, not the username/account ID so her existing card should continue to work.</span></p>
