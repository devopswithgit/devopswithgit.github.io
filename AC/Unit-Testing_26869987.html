                    <p>Unit tests should be written to represent a business logic function.</p><p>Once a unit test is written and passed, it should not change. The implication of changes to a unit test may indicate a feature change. However SOLID principals should ideally be adhered to and so if a feature change is required, it is more likely that business requirements for that feature were not clear enough in the first instance.</p><p>The SOLID 'O' princpal suggests logic should be extended not modified. If the logic needs to be changed so that it does something completely different to the original specification then this can be deemed a new feature and the old feature retired and no longer tested.</p><h2 id="UnitTesting-BenefitsofunittestingAccMan">Benefits of unit testing AccMan</h2><ul><li>Code is written in testable and re-usable components</li><li>If an issue is raised by the user or via exception logging etc, the developer can write a unit test expecting the reported exception and diagnose it easily</li><li>Business requirements are verified and potentials omissions or flaws in design are highlighted at the first stage of development</li><li>Testers can be provided with a list of unit tests and outcomes from Dev environment to compare with QA and UAT testing to aid and to provide confidence</li><li>Not all changes to features may impact the user directly. A bug fix may only be required in a back end process. In this case, a valid unit test can prove that the bug is fixed and it's release will not impact on such critical components</li><li>Critical AccMan processes can be built and deployed with confidence of passed tests.</li><li>Code reviews have a standard structure starting with the feature itself, the validity of the test's assertions and it's outcome to business requirements.</li><li>Team members can navigate unit tests easily and become proficient and familiar with the code base, resulting in a stronger Skills Matrix</li><li>Duplicate code and features are avoided as test names should be easily recognisable as existing features</li><li>Tests can be ignored as part of the build if the development of it is not complete, allowing sustained confidence level between releases</li></ul><h2 id="UnitTesting-AccManUnitTestsreview">AccMan Unit Tests review</h2><p>Currently there are select unit test projects in the AccMan solution. They are well structured and perform a good set of positive tests. There is a large percentage of code blocks not tested which should be to prove a feature works.</p><h3 id="UnitTesting-What&#39;sgood">What's good</h3><ul><li>The tests are fairly well structured and concise without too many multiple asserts per test.</li><li>Good level of Active Directory interfacing and processing logic is tested well</li><li>Good level of MVC controllers tested</li></ul><h3 id="UnitTesting-Whatcouldbebetterandwhy">What could be better and why</h3><ul><li>The naming of tests could be improved to reflect the actual business requirement and the feature which satisfies it</li><li>The class design of the AccManLibrary and AccManBackendLibrary initialise and manage it's own instance of Common.Logging Log manager. This is difficult to test.<br/>The improvement here would be to have a process or service class design which would have it's &quot;log provider&quot; implementation injected to it. This would allow greater testability and easier log management.</li><li>Controller actions should be tested with more specific requirements in mind, e.g. AssociateRequestControllerTest.cs has a test named &quot;Complete&quot;, which only proves that a ViewResult is returned. This is a generic test and the completion of the action should be tested instead. There are similar improvements to be made elsewhere.Â The benefit of this improvement is so that each build and deployment of the codebase can provide confidence that a feature still exists for the business to function.</li><li>More features of the AccMan Library need to be unit tested. See the code coverage levels below e.g. accmanlibrary.dll is only ~7% covered<br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/26869987/26869984.png" data-image-src="attachments/26869987/26869984.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="26869984" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image2016-5-13 11:7:0.png" data-base-url="https://confluence.salford.ac.uk:8444/confluence" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="26869987" data-linked-resource-container-version="6"></span></li></ul>
