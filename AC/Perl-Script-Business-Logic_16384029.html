</div></div><p>From an Email4Life point of view, the reason we are interested in students getting enabled or disabled is this:</p><p>When a student leaves, we do not disable their email account (which is held in Live@Edu), but we do want to hide their address from the Live@Edu address list. This means they can still send/receive emails with their Salford email address (forever) but the address list will only contain accounts for students who are currently studying. Otherwise the address list will become huge.</p><p>When enabling an account, we always want to make sure the student's email appears in the address list. However when disabling an account, the decision about hiding their address from the list depends on <em>why</em> their account was disabled. If they were kicked off their course for some reason, we don't want them to keep their email account. But if they have graduated and are therefore an alumnus, we do want them to keep their email account (but we also want to hide their address from the address list).</p><p>In the disable function, therefore, we have this bit of logic</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeHeader panelHeader pdl" style="border-bottom-width: 1px;"><b>Fragment from the disable() function</b></div><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
