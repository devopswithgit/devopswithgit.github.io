system.<br/>This fix requires minor changes to sap_import.pl to create a flag that gets set if the department code changes, and then create a type 121 transaction (which updates the AD department field) if that flag is set.<br/>To test, change the department code in the sap_import table, run the sap_import.pl script, and see if a type 121 transaction is generated.  The type 121 transaction is already live and working, so no testing of this element is required.<br/>                See http://uos-d-dbld-01:8090/display/AC/204752+Staff+AD+Department+Changes for further details.<br/><br/>Backout process for all of the above is to revert the DLL files/perl scripts as per usual.<br/><br/>Julia’s Cohort SVN Branch has now been merged in to the Associates Branch which already contains Allan’s modifications.  The Subversion revision number for release is 3609.<br/><br/>There’s some more detail of the release here:
