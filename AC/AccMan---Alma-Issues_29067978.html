                    <p>The initial starting point for this discussion between the Library [ Andy ] and ITS [Jon and Vipul] was Landesk case REQ/60484 - &quot;Request to review Accman's algorithm for determining students' 'final year' status&quot;.</p><p>This was based on two users ...</p><ul><ul><li>BTB479, @00386467, Naeema       Asmal</li><li>EQB217, @00395792, Mohammad,       Khan Azeem</li></ul></ul><p>... where Accman indicated that the students are final year but the students themselves said that they were still active - and Student Admin confirmed this.</p><p>Since that case was raised, a number of other issues in the same general area of data consistency between Banner, Accman, and Alma have arisen.  These issues have mainly come to light because of a new business process in the Library for handling 'lost loan' charges, which relies on using data in Alma rather than in Banner.</p><p> </p><p><em>&lt;list of JIRA cases with links to the cases&gt;</em></p><p><em><em>Accman indicates student is final year but Banner contradicts this <a href="https://jira.salford.ac.uk:8443/jira/browse/ARF-374" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://jira.salford.ac.uk:8443/jira/browse/ARF-374</a></em></em></p><p><em>Multiple Alma transactions processed in a short period of time</em></p><p><em>No Alma transactions generated for a user</em></p><p><em>Alma transaction fails because Janus card data is missing or does not have expected form</em></p><p><em>Status in Accman is account Valid, person Graduating, but expiry date in Alma is several months in the past</em></p><p><em><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">Username has been extended in Accman but Alma expiry date (27/5/16) is still in the past</span></em> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Student Final Year issues - background information</strong></p><p>We have recently come across a number anomalies in student data in Alma.</p><p>The starting point for this was that the Library’s LBPQ (Library Business Process and Quality) team were processing ‘lost book invoices’ – i.e. chasing up cases where final year students had not returned their books at the end of their course.</p><p>They had noticed a number of cases where students had an expiry date of 27 May 2016 in Alma [this date being the current default expiry date set by the Accman-Alma interface for final year undergraduate students], but they did not have an Alma user group indicating a final year student.</p><p>Further investigation led to discovery of some other anomalies. </p><p>Some of these are connected with the way that Accman-Alma transactions are generated (or ‘triggered’) – this can include cases where ‘too many’ transactions are generated or can include cases where a transaction is not being generated when perhaps it should be.</p><p>However, most of the anomalies are connected with the way that Accman-Alma transactions are processed after they have been generated.</p><p><em>Note: when investigating/debugging individual anomalies, it might be useful to have a facility in Accman to generate an Accman-Alma transaction for one individual username. This would help us to disconnect any concerns about how and when transactions are generated (or not) from concerns about how a transaction is processed – we would always be able to generate a transaction at will, knowing that it would operate on Accman data as it exists at the time we generate the transaction (or very soon afterwards).</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>What has changed to suddenly prompt this issue?</strong></p><p>This seems to be more of an issue this year as compared to the same time last year and we think the main reason for this is a change of business process in the Library regarding the processing of ‘lost book invoices’. </p><p>The way this used to work last year is that any final year student who had not returned their books at the end of the course were chased by the library to return them but, if they did not respond they would then be liable to pay the replacement cost of the book(s).  The details of their debt were entered into Banner, and the student would be invoiced by the Finance department, using Banner data.</p><p>The way this now works is that after being chased to return the books, they become liable to pay the replacement cost of the book(s) as before, but now the student is invoiced by the Library, using Alma data.</p><p>Also, within the last year, changes have been made in the Accman-Alma interface that amongst other things,</p><p>(a)    Supports an expanded set of Alma user groups so that the group name includes an indication of whether the student is Final Year</p><p>(b)   Includes the mobile phone number – to assist the LBPQ team when contacting students who owe lost book charges</p><p>So, the LBPQ team now has an increased reliance on Alma data that is populated from Accman, in particular, the expiry date, the user group, and the mobile phone number.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Students who have left without graduating</strong></p><p>A specific scenario that seems to follow from the changes described above is where a student leaves the university without graduating.</p><p>If a student graduates then, at some point, a graduation date is passed from Banner to the Accman end_date field, and from there to the Alma expiry date field.  This will happen via an Accman-Alma transaction being generated and processed – and this transaction will set a user group that includes ‘final year’ – and it will set a mobile phone number.  If this user had another Accman-Alma transaction generated at some point in the future then, assuming nothing had changed in Banner, it would simply re-confirm the expiry date, user group, etc.</p><p>However, if a student leaves without graduating, a graduation date is not set in Banner.  We do not think that any other leaving date is set in Banner, or if it is, we do not think it is ever copied to the Accman end_date field.  Because the end date is blank in Accman, whenever an Accman-Alma transaction is processed for this user, the logic in the Accman-Alma interface that determines a default end date will be used.</p><p>Furthermore, for a student in this situation, we think that once a default end date of 27/5/16 was set by an Alma transaction earlier in the year, no further Alma transactions for the student were generated by either a Janus card change or a Banner data change – so the student still had an old usergroup value that had been set before the changes to include a final year indication in the user group.</p><p> </p>
