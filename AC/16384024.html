                    <p>We had an incident (Support Case 254814 d/d. 06/08/2012) were a Library Enquiry Desk Specialist was interpreting the Alumnus Status of a student as implying that the student's network account was disabled.  The following email explains the difference between Person / Account Status in AccMan and their &quot;is_alumnus&quot; status . . . .</p><p> </p><p>Hi Roy,</p><p>Looking in AccMan, the account status for student PYP865 is PRESENT / VALID, therefore, as I understand it they should still be able to log in to the network and be able to use the printing facilities.</p><p>At the point when the student has <u>officially</u> left the University their AccMan status will change to LEFT / DISABLED.  At this time they will neither be able to log in to the network nor will they be able to log in to the On-line Printer Credits System.  Consequently they should never be in a position where they can make a mistake and pay in to an account that will no longer support printing.</p><p>As I understand it, schools can sometimes be late in changing some student statuses to ‘LEFT’, which may be the reason this student can still log in to the network.</p><p>It is important to note though that the students “Alumnus” status in AccMan is something very different from the “Account Status” mentioned above.</p><p>Students are flagged as “Alumni” after they have graduated.  This simply acts as a flag to AccMan to say that when their network account is eventually disabled, then their Live@Edu email account will not also be disabled.  This is so we can provide graduates with “Email for Life”.</p><p>I hope this answers your query and please let me know if there is anything that I have misunderstood.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Julia.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
