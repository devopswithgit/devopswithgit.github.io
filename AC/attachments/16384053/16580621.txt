Expected outage
Hopefully a couple of hours but could take all day.

Prior to release

•	Shut down the AccmanWeb user interface so that users cannot use it at all. 
•	Inform the users that Accman will not be available until further notice (could take all day. Hopefully not but it’s going to be an unpleasant release).
•	Operations need to back up the Accman database.
•	Shut down all running Perl scripts (new and old servers).
•	Disable all scheduled tasks (new and old servers).
•	Stop ConsoleSchedulerService (new and old servers).

Database Changes

EmailForLife
For EmailForLife, we also need to add a new field to the PERSON table called “is_alumnus”:

alter table PERSON add is_alumnus tinyint(4)

DepartmentChange
Execute the attached script department_codes_update.sql

Code to release:

.NET Accman branches:
EmailForLife:     svn://isd-sysarch01.isdads.salford.ac.uk/UoS_IdM/Accman.NET/branches/EmailForLife
DepartmentChange: svn://isd-sysarch01.isdads.salford.ac.uk/UoS_IdM/Accman.NET/branches/DepartmentChange2012

These have both been merged (locally) into the Accman trunk which is at: 
                svn://isd-sysarch01.isdads.salford.ac.uk/UoS_IdM/Accman.NET/branches/Associates

Code to release:
                The compiled version of AccmanBackendLibrary with the above branches merged into it. 

Steps to release:

1.	Backup the contents of C:\AccmanBackEndLibrary on both servers
2.	Copy the newly built DLLs into C:\AccmanBackEndLibrary (overwriting the existing files)
3.	Modify C:\ConsoleSchedulerService\quartz-jobs.xml to include the new configuration for the DepartmentChange and EmailForLife jobs.
4.	Start ConsoleSchedulerService
5.	Verify that there are no error messages in the log files and that it has started correctly. 

Perl Scripts
The Perl script changes are harder to manage but we can release them in the following way (from http://uos-d-dbld-01:8090/display/AC/Email+for+Life)

1.	Back up the scripts on accmanbe and uos-p-acbe-01 by making a copy of c:\accman on both servers
2.	Copy all the Perl scripts from test to a local development PC e.g. C:\AccmanCompare\FromTest
3.	Copy all the production scripts to a similar folder e.g. C:\AccmanCompare\FromProduction
4.	Use something like TotalCommander to compare all the files and see what's changed
5.	Identify which changes have been made just to get them to work at all in test (database connection strings etc)
6.	Identify which changes are specific to Email4Life and DepartmentChange - these are the changes we want to copy into production
7.	Copy the changes over to the production scripts
8.	Put the modified changes onto the production server
9.	Restart all the Perl scripts and enable all scheduled tasks
10.	I imagine Accman will be down for about a day while we do this, because it's going to be messy.

Backout Plan
Stop all running Perl scripts, ConsoleScheduler, and disable the scheduled tasks
Restore the backed up files from C:\AccmanBackEndLibrary, C:\Accman and also the file C:\ConsoleSchedulerService\quartz-jobs.xml
Start all Perl scripts, ConsoleScheduler, and enable the scheduled tasks
